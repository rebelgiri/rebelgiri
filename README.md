## HelloðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my Github Profile 
I am Giri, I am an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, I am interested in designing and implementing AI/ML-driven solutions, using agile and scrum software development life cycle :blush:.

I have finished my Master in Embedded Systems from the Technical University of Chemnitz. I have pursued research in Unsupervised learning and Generative adversarial networks.

Prior, I have an ample experience in C and C++ Programming on Cross-Platform application development. I have a sound understanding of GNU Linux OS as I have worked as Linux System Programmer with MNCs like Huawei Technologies and UST Global (deputed at Intel).

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
* A research project in the area of Multi-Object Multi-Camera Tracking for Pedestrians :heart_eyes:.

* Worked on a C++ project related to Sensor Data Fusion, in which Bayesian Networks were used to estimate the driving direction of lanes. 

#### ðŸŒ± I am looking forward to gaining expertise in ...
* Computer Vision.
* Deep Learning and Machine Learning (Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow).
* Algorithms and Data Structures.
* Bayesian Networks and Predictive Filters like Kalman.

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to compete on ...
* Hackerrank :relaxed:.
* Kaggle :heart_eyes:.
