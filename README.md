## HelloðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my Github Profile 
I'm Giri, an avid Artificial Intelligence enthusiast with a keen interest in crafting and implementing AI/ML-driven solutions, leveraging the agile and scrum software development life cycle. ðŸ˜Š

I hold a Master's degree in Embedded Systems from the Technical University of Chemnitz, where my research focused on Unsupervised Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks.

My prior experience involves extensive work in C and C++ programming for Cross-Platform application development. I possess a strong grasp of the GNU Linux operating system, having served as a Linux System Programmer at renowned companies like Huawei Technologies and UST Global (deputed at Intel). 

I have actively contributed to numerous C++ projects with a primary focus on Sensor Data Fusion. One notable example includes utilizing Bayesian Networks to estimate the driving direction of lanes. Presently, I am engaged in automotive software development, adhering to ISO 26262 and ASIL compliances.

#### ðŸ”­ I'm presently engaged in ...

* A Predictive Maintenance project using Deep Learning and Vibration data for Condition Monitoring of Industrial Machinary :heart_eyes:.

* A research project in the area of Multi-Object Multi-Camera Tracking for Pedestrians :heart_eyes:.

* Worked on a C++ project related to Sensor Data Fusion, in which Bayesian Networks were used to estimate the driving direction of lanes. 

#### ðŸŒ± I am looking forward to gaining expertise in ...
* Computer Vision.
* Deep Learning and Machine Learning (Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow).
* Algorithms and Data Structures.
* Bayesian Networks and Predictive Filters like Kalman.

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to compete on ...
* Hackerrank :relaxed:.
* Kaggle :heart_eyes:.
